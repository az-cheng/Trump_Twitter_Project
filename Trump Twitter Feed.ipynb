A Markov chain is a randomly determined model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. What does this mean?\n\nWe'll make a key-value dictionary where each key is a two word phrase and each value is a list containing all the possible single words that come after that phrase. Here's a concrete example. Read it carefully, paying special attention to the \"and i\" phrase.\n\n\"hi my name is Al and i live in a box that i like very much and i can live in there as long as i want\"\n\n\"hi my\" -> [\"name\"]\n\n\"my name\" -> [\"is\"]\n\n\"name is\" -> [\"Al\"]\n\n\"is Al\" -> [\"and\"]\n\n\"Al and\" -> [\"i\"]\n\n\"and i\" -> [\"live\"]\n\n........\n\n\"and i\" -> [\"live\", \"can\"]\n\n........\n\n\"i can\" -> [\"live\"]\n\n......\n\nMake a dictionary that does this type of Markov chain for all_tweets called word_dict below.
